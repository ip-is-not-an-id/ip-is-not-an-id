Hi World. I'm currently enrolled in a undergrad program in science, so I especially into projects that are related to the same.
I am really curious about anything science related and even some in law or management fields, so feel free to drop a hi or invite me to code with your team ;}
I am also interested in chess and such problem solving puzzles.
Looking forward to working with you on interesting projects,
       Yours Truly.
