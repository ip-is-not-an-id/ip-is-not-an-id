Hi. I'm currently enrolled in a undergrad program in science, so I am especially into projects that are related to the same.
I am really curious about anything science related, ( so feel free to drop a hi or invite me to code with your team : P.S. I am currently not available ) 
Interested in chess and problem solving puzzles like logical riddles, crosswords, and sudoku.
I also like probability and statistics, but, I'm still learning, ...
Looking forward to working with you on interesting projects,
       Yours Truly.
